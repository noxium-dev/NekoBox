## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Authentication Requirements

- Some **gallery-dl** sites may require authentication

### Site Compatibility
- Some sites may experience temporary issues due to:

  - Rate limiting
  - Regional restrictions
- We actively monitor and update scrapers

### Performance Tips
- **Concurrent downloads**: Start with 10-20, adjust based on your connection
